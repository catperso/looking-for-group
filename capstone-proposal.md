## _Name of Student:_ **Matt Casperson**

# _Name of Project:_ **Looking For Group**

### _Project's Purpose or Goal (What will it do for users?):_
* A network to coordinate players and dungeon masters to put together sessions or campaigns of Dungeons And Dragons. Whether the games happen remotely or in person is up to the users.

### _List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:_
* Users can sign up / sign in to accounts on the network
* Users can see list of all **Games** and detail on individual games
* Users can create a **Game** with full CRUD functionality as that game's Dungeon Master (DM)
* Individual games will include a description of what the DM has planned and functionality for other users to sign up as players in that game
* User profiles display all games they have created as DMs and all games they have signed onto as players

### _What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific._
* NPM / Webpack
* HTML
* Bootstrap / CSS
* JavaScript / JSX
* React / Redux
* Firebase / Firestore
* NoSQL

### _If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific._
* Add searchable tags to games and a search function to the game list
* Let users create games as players and sign up to games as DMs (aka invert the default setup)
* DnD 5E API integration for quick ingame reference
* More extravagant and thematic styling
* Deploying the network for anyone to use

### _What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?_
* [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)

### _Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?_
* I'm certain I could implement this with Ruby/Rails and PostgreSQL, but I'm excited to try the challenge of using the newest material in the curriculum instead.
